# Controllers

This package contains HTTP handlers responsible for processing incoming API requests and interacting with the service layer.

## Files

- `game.go` – Handles endpoints related to creating, updating, and retrieving games.
- `player.go` – Manages player assignment and data per game.
- `scoring.go` – Processes scoring updates and tracks objective completion.

Controllers define the API logic and delegate core functionality to the services layer.
