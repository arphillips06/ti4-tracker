# Models

This package defines the core data structures used throughout the application.

## Common Models

- `Game` – Represents a single Twilight Imperium game, including players and scores.
- `Player` – Represents a player in a game.
- `Objective` – Describes a public or secret objective.

These models are used by the controllers, services, and database layers to ensure consistent data structures.
