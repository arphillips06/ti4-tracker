## What Is This?
This is my monorepo for a project to track games and stats of Twilight Imperium 4 (TI4) games.

## Why?
Because I can? No, really — whilst there are plenty of apps that can do similar things, my gaming group wanted something that could track player stats as well as wider game stats.
This is mostly because we're too competitive… but that's best left on the gaming table.

I also used it as an opportunity to learn Go and a little bit of JavaScript. What I've learned is that I don't like JavaScript — and that's OK, as I've never wanted to be a frontend dev.
However, the Go experience has been great and is something I hope to use in my day job as a network engineer one day.

## Who?
Well, me. I’ve also taken input from my friends on what it should look like, and I'm hoping to get them to learn some coding and contribute — but life is busy. :)

## Updates?
I still use two private Git repos to develop against. This is mostly because it helps me keep things separate in my mind when working and pushing updates.
The plan is to update this monorepo monthly.

## Want to use this? 
You crazy person! However if you look in the [front/back]end folders, you'll find more detailed READMEs with instructions on how each part works and how you can run it locally.
