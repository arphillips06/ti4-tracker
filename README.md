# TI4 Tracker

This is the monorepo for 2 personal projects. 

The app is designed to track a full game of Twilight Imperium 4 and then serve the stats of all games entered. This was made as there is nothing made by the community that does this. 

## TI4 Backend
This is my Go project that facilitates the input from the frontend puts the input into a sqlite database, which is then served back. 
As a learning project I have tried to keep to DRY princables and Go best practicies. 
This was made by using the skills in Go I have learnt at my role in work and an interest in coding. 

## TI4 Frontend
This is a website using JS. Serves the game funtionality as well as stats pages. This was made primarily using AI as I know no JS.
